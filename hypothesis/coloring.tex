\subsection*{Colouring}
We cannot independently smooth all verticies in the mesh simultaniously since a vertex depends on it's adjacent verticies. If these were smoothed at the same time the results would not be correct and so these must be locked down. We can however colour verticies of the mesh and run each independent set simultenously on the GPU.
Coloring is the first step that must be performed when porting the code across to the GPU.
We will experiment with a greedy algorithm that finds the first possible colour a vertex can fall in, and thus may not prove to be an optimal solution but will provide satisfactory results.
