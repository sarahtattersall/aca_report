We have been provided with a piece of code that concerns a computational kernel extracted from a research project at Imperial College London on dynamic mesh adaptation\cite{pragmatic}.
The aim of this series of experiments was to figure out how to run this program as fast as possible on a given architecture.

We have been given access to the HPC's PC cluster to run the results of our experiment on.
Since the HPC system uses the PBS Pro queuing system to manage the execution of jobs on the compute resources it can often take some time to run a single result.
Since our project predomenantly involved porting the code to the GPU we also developed our code on the lab machines.
