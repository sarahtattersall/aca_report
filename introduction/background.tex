We have been provided with a piece of code that concerns a computational kernel extracted from a research project at Imperial College London on dynamic mesh adaptation\cite{pragmatic}.
The aim of this series of experiments is to figure out how to run this program as fast as possible on a given architecture.

We have been given access to the HPC's PC cluster to run the results of our experiment on.
Unfortunately since the HPC system uses the PBS Pro queueing system to manage the execution of jobs on the compute resources it can often take some time to run a single result. The wait times can be up to twenty minutes for a single job and sadly this has made it infeasible to develop for cx1. We will therefore optimise for the lab machine detailed in further sections.
