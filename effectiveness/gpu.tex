\subsection*{GPU}
Once the verticies have been colored and the code migrated to the GPU the initial results are as follows.\\
\begin{tabular}{ l | l }
  \hline
  Size & Average Over Three Time \\
  \hline
  \hline
  small & 2.18s \\
  medium & 14.99 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

As we can see, moving the code to the GPU and parallelising it makes a huge difference to the performance of this algorithm.
From profiling the small.vtk run we can gather the following statistics as a benchmark to start from:\\
\begin{tabular}{ l | l | l | l}
\hline
Test & Average & Min & Max \\
\hline
\hline
gld\_request & 16193.80 & 418.00 & 32424.00 \\
gputime & 1402.99 & 149.63 & 2170.59 \\
occupancy & 0.22 & 0.03 & 0.25 \\
gst\_request & 168.29 & 2.00 & 384.00 \\
cputime & 1430.26 & 165.00 & 2703.00 \\
branch & 1627.76 & 214.00 & 3372.00 \\
divergent\_branch & 83.44 & 7.00 & 185.00 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

From profiling we can see that the warps have very high average devergent which leads us nicely onto the next topic of reordering.
