\subsection{Original Code}
Running the original code yields the following results.\\
\begin{figure}[H]\centering \begin{tabular}{ l | l }
  \hline
  Size & Average Over Three Time (s) \\
  \hline
  \hline
  small & 9.33 \\
  medium & 69.70 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular} \end{figure}

This is a good benchmark for us to work from and will be used in the final results to assess our overall speedup.
